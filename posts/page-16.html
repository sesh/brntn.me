        <p>There's still quite a few TODOs on <code>briefly</code> because I can release the source. Slowly getting closer but it's potentially a couple of weekends away before I can start encouraging other people to use it.</p>
<p>In the mean time: I re-released <a href="https://ratingthings.net">Rating Things</a> with Twitter authentication (LOL, no Indieweb there) and üëç / üëé ratings instead of 5 stars. One thing that's a pain in the arse: checking if a string contains nothing but emojis.</p>

<p>And just like that I'm all of a sudden very glad that unroll.me stopped working.</p>
<p>From a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html">profile on Travis Kalanick</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers‚Äô emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft‚Äôs business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that customers‚Äô names are not attached) based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information.</p>
