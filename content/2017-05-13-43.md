I re-joined [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) today and completed one of their introduction Swift / iOS development courses. Between that, [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/), and the most recent project I'm working on at Common Code, I've been somewhat inspired to attempt a short series of Django screencasts.
