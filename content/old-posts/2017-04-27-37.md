There's still quite a few TODOs on `briefly` because I can release the source. Slowly getting closer but it's potentially a couple of weekends away before I can start encouraging other people to use it.

In the mean time: I re-released [Rating Things](https://ratingthings.net) with Twitter authentication (LOL, no Indieweb there) and 👍 / 👎 ratings instead of 5 stars. One thing that's a pain in the arse: checking if a string contains nothing but emojis.
