So I went from "microblogging" most days, to barely touching this in a month.

Lot's going on at work: Teaching a team at a client Python! Continuing to work on a few very interesting projects.

Lot's going on project wise: [Rating Things](https://ratingthings.net) is a think that I want to use. [HN 500](https://hn500.brntn.me) gives me daily news highlights. Plus I'm toying with a few other Swift + tvOS ideas.

And personally: Heading to Sydney this weekend because Bonnie is doing a working for Vivid. Heading the Adelaide the next week for the long weekend. And heading to the USA in September for a proper break.
