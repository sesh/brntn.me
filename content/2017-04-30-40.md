Three things I did today.

- Fixed the RSS feeds on Briefly, so that it gets pulled into micro.blog properly
- Created an (amazing!) app icon for [Rating Things](https://ratingthings.net). Add it to your home screen on iOS to see it in it's purple glory.
- Had brunch at [Code Black](http://codeblackcoffee.com.au) in Brunswick. Always interesting food there. I had baked beans with poached eggs.
