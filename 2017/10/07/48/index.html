        <p>So that's it! What an adventure the last four and a half years at Common Code has been. I can't speak more highly of the incredible team and great clients I was able to work with.</p>
<p>Common Code gave me an amazing opportunity to grow as a developer and team leader, which I'll forever be appreciative of.</p>
<p>Common Code will continue to grow. The team will continue to create great things. I can't wait to see what happens next.</p>
<p>I'm going to do something else for a bit.</p>
<p>See you at MelbDjango!</p>
