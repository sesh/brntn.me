Last night at MelbDjango I did a quick "tab dump" talk where I introduced people to some podcasts, new projects and Django news.

Here are the links:

### Django Itself

- The [Django 1.11 release notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/)
- You too can [Dontate to the DSF](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/) like Daryl and myself did on stage
- The proposed new ["It worked"](https://chadwhitman.github.io/congrats/django/) page is awesome. It would be a great Django 2.0 feature
- Django 1.11.1 isn't out yet, but the [release notes](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/releases/1.11.1/) already include a number of bug fixes


### Python Podcasts

- [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/) longer-form interview based show
- [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) for weekly Python news
- [podcast.\_\_init\_\_](https://www.podcastinit.com/) - new one to me (thanks to the audience member who yelled this one out)


### Cool projects

- Elky is back with [django-flat-responsive](https://github.com/elky/django-flat-responsive), a _responsive_ admin theme.
- I found [Djagno Apps Checklist](http://djangoappschecklist.com/) on Github and will definitely look at using it for my next reusable Django app.
- [Flango](https://github.com/kennethreitz/flango) is Kenneth Reitz's somewhat crazy take on using the Django ORM with Flask's views / URL routing.


We also touched on the idea of "scratching your own itch" to get into Django and Python.
I recommended [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) as a practical programming tutorial with that aim.
Then I showed of my own list of [tiny websites](https://brntn.me/tiny-websites/) that are mostly built with Django and do small things I'd otherwise do manually.
