Had a great catch up with [Spry](https://twitter.com/spry) yesterday, and ended up with three things to check out:

- The <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">Destroy All Software</a> screencast series
- <a href="https://thimbleweedpark.com/">Thimbleweed Park</a> which Josh backed on kickstarter.
- <a href="http://www.iview.abc.net.au/collection/you-cant-ask-that">You Canâ€™t Ask That</a> on ABC iView.
