<p>And just like that I'm all of a sudden very glad that unroll.me stopped working.</p>
<p>From a New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html">profile on Travis Kalanick</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that customers’ names are not attached) based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information.</p>

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>Last night at MelbDjango I did a quick &quot;tab dump&quot; talk where I introduced people to some podcasts, new projects and Django news.</p>
<p>Here are the links:</p>
<h3>Django Itself</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/">Django 1.11 release notes</a></li>
<li>You too can <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">Dontate to the DSF</a> like Daryl and myself did on stage</li>
<li>The proposed new <a href="https://chadwhitman.github.io/congrats/django/">&quot;It worked&quot;</a> page is awesome. It would be a great Django 2.0 feature</li>
<li>Django 1.11.1 isn't out yet, but the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/releases/1.11.1/">release notes</a> already include a number of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python Podcasts</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://talkpython.fm/">Talk Python to Me</a> longer-form interview based show</li>
<li><a href="https://pythonbytes.fm/">Python Bytes</a> for weekly Python news</li>
<li><a href="https://www.podcastinit.com/">podcast.__init__</a> - new one to me (thanks to the audience member who yelled this one out)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cool projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elky is back with <a href="https://github.com/elky/django-flat-responsive">django-flat-responsive</a>, a <em>responsive</em> admin theme.</li>
<li>I found <a href="http://djangoappschecklist.com/">Djagno Apps Checklist</a> on Github and will definitely look at using it for my next reusable Django app.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/flango">Flango</a> is Kenneth Reitz's somewhat crazy take on using the Django ORM with Flask's views / URL routing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also touched on the idea of &quot;scratching your own itch&quot; to get into Django and Python.
I recommended <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff</a> as a practical programming tutorial with that aim.
Then I showed of my own list of <a href="https://brntn.me/tiny-websites/">tiny websites</a> that are mostly built with Django and do small things I'd otherwise do manually.</p>

    <div class="e-content">
        <p>Today I merged and deployed #micropub support for Briefly.</p>
<p>Still lots of small things to clean up before I can release it, including getting a nice authentication and deployment strategy happening. Hoping to do that <em>this weekend</em> which could make Monday / Tuesday next week the target for release.</p>
