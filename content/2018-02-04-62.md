### 3 problems I've had with the ANNE Pro 60% keyboard layout

I recently picked up the [ANNED Pro 60% bluetooth keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Pro-Bluetooth-compatible-Smartphone/dp/B06XW87X9D). After a week of use, I have a few complaints.

1. fn+cmd locks the cmd key into "off" mode. This makes already awkward MacOS shortcuts like cmd+option+left to switch tabs next to impossible to do without accidentally breaking cmd. _Fix: use cmd+shift+[ instead_.
2. Having fn on the right only makes using your right hand for arrow keys hard. I got really used to being able to do this on the Kogan ten keyless keyboard.
3. Hitting ~ (something I use a lot) is a really awkward combination of fn+shift+esc. Not really sure how this can be improved - perhaps I'll try mapping ~ to caps lock.

Otherwise, ignoring some bluetooth hiccups, I'm loving using this keyboard.
