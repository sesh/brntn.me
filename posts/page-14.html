        <p>So that's it! What an adventure the last four and a half years at Common Code has been. I can't speak more highly of the incredible team and great clients I was able to work with.</p>
<p>Common Code gave me an amazing opportunity to grow as a developer and team leader, which I'll forever be appreciative of.</p>
<p>Common Code will continue to grow. The team will continue to create great things. I can't wait to see what happens next.</p>
<p>I'm going to do something else for a bit.</p>
<p>See you at MelbDjango!</p>

        <p>I'm going to ditch my homepage / blog again, in favour of something tiny and fast. That means reviving this for my quick updates!</p>

        <p>I made a tiny website for runners: <a href="http://runningtables.info">Running tables</a>.</p>
<p>It's a simple running pace and distance chart for looking up min/km and min/mi conversions. If it annoys you when someone says a pace in miles (or kms), this is for you!</p>

        <p>So I went from &quot;microblogging&quot; most days, to barely touching this in a month.</p>
<p>Lot's going on at work: Teaching a team at a client Python! Continuing to work on a few very interesting projects.</p>
<p>Lot's going on project wise: <a href="https://ratingthings.net">Rating Things</a> is a think that I want to use. <a href="https://hn500.brntn.me">HN 500</a> gives me daily news highlights. Plus I'm toying with a few other Swift + tvOS ideas.</p>
<p>And personally: Heading to Sydney this weekend because Bonnie is doing a working for Vivid. Heading the Adelaide the next week for the long weekend. And heading to the USA in September for a proper break.</p>
