[`scratchpad`](https://sesh.github.io/scratchpad/) is a place for notes.
The notes are saved in your browser so they should be there when you come back.

### Contributing

Feel free to contribute features and bugfixes. Let's keep the javascript vanilla.

If you'd like to confirm that I'll be willing to merge a new feature, please raise an Issue first.

### Others

The "write things down and save it to localstorage" space is surprisingly crowded.

And I'm sure hundreds more... Scratchpad has no real differentiating features. It's a textarea, some CSS and some Javascript.
